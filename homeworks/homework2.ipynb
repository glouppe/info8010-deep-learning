    "Let's explain what we just did. Thanks to PyTorch's [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) sub-library, we just downloaded the CIFAR10 dataset on our machine. The dataset was stored in the `./data` folder and comes in two different forms thanks to the use of the `train` flag: a version that can be used as training set, and a version that can be used as testing set. These two datasets are subclasses of `torch`'s `data.Dataset` class. We will see later what this `data.Dataset` class consists in exactly. Torchvision also allows us to define a set of image transformations which we have defined at the beginning of this cell: in this case we would like to convert our images to tensors, see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.ToTensor) for an exact description of this transformation.\n",

The advantage of data loaders is that they (can) perform pre-processing of the data in parallel, i.e. in several concurrent worker pools.\n",
