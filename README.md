## Homeworks

The goal of these two assignments is to get you familiar with the PyTorch library. You can find the installation instructions in the [Homeworks](./homeworks) folder.
Each homework should be done in groups of 2 or 3 (the same as for the project) and must be submitted **before 23:59 on the due date**.
Homeworks should be submitted on Gradescope.

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/glouppe/info8010-deep-learning/raw/master/homeworks/homework1.ipynb): Tensor operations, `autograd` and `nn`. Due by **March 16**.
- [Homework 2](https://github.com/glouppe/info8010-deep-learning/raw/master/homeworks/homework2.ipynb): Dataset, Dataloader, running on GPU, training a convolutional neural network. Due by **March 30**.

Homeworks are optional. If submitted, each homework will account for 5% of the final grade.
