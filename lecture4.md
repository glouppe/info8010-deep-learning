## A practical recommendation

Training a massive deep neural network is long, complex and sometimes confusing. 

A first step towards understanding, debugging and optimizing neural networks is to make use of visualization tools for
- plotting losses and metrics, 
- visualizing computational graphs,
- or showing additional data as the network is being trained.

# Gradient descent

To minimize $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$, 
standard **batch gradient descent** (GD) consists in applying the update rule
$$\begin{aligned}
g\_t &= \frac{1}{N} \sum\_{n=1}^N \nabla\_\theta \ell(y\_n, f(\mathbf{x}\_n; \theta\_t)) \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \gamma g\_t,
\end{aligned}$$
where $\gamma$ is the learning rate.

## Stochastic gradient descent

While it makes sense to compute the gradient exactly,
- it takes time to compute and becomes inefficient for large $N$,
- it is an empirical estimation of an hidden quantity (the expected risk), and any partial sum is also an unbiased estimate, although of greater variance.

To illustrate how partial sums are good estimates, consider an ideal case where the training set is the same set of $M \ll N$ samples replicated $K$ times. Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\theta) &= \frac{1}{N} \sum\_{i=n}^N \ell(y\_n, f(\mathbf{x}\_n; \theta)) \\\\
&=\frac{1}{N} \sum\_{k=1}^K \sum\_{m=1}^M \ell(y\_m, f(\mathbf{x}\_m; \theta)) \\\\
&=\frac{1}{N} K \sum\_{m=1}^M \ell(y\_m, f(\mathbf{x}\_m; \theta)).
\end{aligned}$$
Then, instead of summing over all the samples and moving by $\gamma$, we can visit only $M=N/K$ samples and move by $K\gamma$, which would cut the computation by $K$.

Although this is an ideal case, there is redundancy in practice that results in similar behaviors.

To reduce the computational complexity, **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) consists in updating the parameters after every sample
$$\begin{aligned}
g\_t &= \nabla\_\theta \ell(y\_{n(t)}, f(\mathbf{x}\_{n(t)}; \theta\_t)) \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \gamma g\_t.

While being computationally faster than batch gradient descent,
- gradient estimates used by SGD can be *very noisy*, which may help escape from local minima;
- but SGD does not benefit from the speed-up of **batch-processing**.

---

class: middle

## Mini-batching

Instead, **mini-batch** SGD consists in visiting the samples in mini-batches and updating the parameters each time
$$
\begin{aligned}
g\_t &= \frac{1}{B} \sum\_{b=1}^B \nabla\_\theta \ell(y\_{n(t,b)}, f(\mathbf{x}\_{n(t,b)}; \theta\_t)) \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \gamma g\_t,
\end{aligned}
$$
where the order ${n(t,b)}$ to visit the samples can be either sequential or random.

- Increasing the batch size $B$ reduces the variance of the gradient estimates and enables the speed-up of batch processing.
- The interplay between $B$ and $\gamma$ is still unclear.

## Limitations

Gradient descent makes strong assumptions about

- the isotropy of the curvature, so that the same step size $\gamma$ makes sense in all directions.

## Wolfe conditions

Let us consider a function $f$ to minimize along $x$, following a direction of descent $p$.

For $0 < c\_1 < c\_2 < 1$, the Wolfe conditions on the step size $\gamma$ are as follows:
- Sufficient decrease condition:
$$f(x + \gamma p) \leq f(x) + c\_1 \gamma p^T \nabla f(x)$$
- Curvature condition:
$$c\_2 p^T \nabla f(x) \leq p^T \nabla f(x + \gamma p)$$

Typical values are $c\_1 = 10^{-4}$ and $c\_2 = 0.9$.

???

- The sufficient decrease condition ensures that the function decreases sufficiently, as predicted by the slope of f in the direction p.
- The curvature condition ensures that steps are not too short by ensuring that the slope has decreased (in magnitude) by some relative amount.

Wolfe conditions could be used to design **line search** algorithms to automatically determine a step size $\gamma\_t$, hence *ensuring convergence* towards a local minima.

However, in deep learning,
- these algorithms are impractical because of the size of the parameter space and the overhead it would induce,
- they might lead to *overfitting* when the empirical risk is minimized too well.

## The tradeoffs of large-scale learning 

A fundamental result due to Bottou and Bousquet (2011) states that stochastic optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD) yield the best generalization performance (in terms of excess error) despite being the worst optimization algorithms for minimizing the empirical risk.

That is,  .bold[for a fixed computational budget, stochastic optimization algorithms reach a lower test error than more sophisticated algorithms] (2nd order methods, line search algorithms, etc) that would fit the training error too well or would consume too large a part of the computational budget at every step.

With momentum, we're essentially treating the optimization process like a physical system where a particle is moving through the parameter space, subject to both:

- A force pushing it in the direction of the negative gradient
- Inertia that causes it to continue moving in its current direction

You can visualize momentum as a ball rolling down a hill - it builds up speed in consistent downward directions while resisting rapid changes in its trajectory when encountering small bumps.

---

class: middle

An improvement to gradient descent is to use **momentum** to add inertia in the choice of the step direction, that is

$$\begin{aligned}
u\_t  &= \alpha u\_{t-1} - \gamma g\_t \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t + u\_t.
\end{aligned}$$

.grid[
.kol-2-3[
- The new variable $u\_t$ is the velocity. It corresponds to the direction and speed by which the parameters move as the learning dynamics progresses, modeled as an exponentially decaying moving average of negative gradients.
- Gradient descent with momentum has three nice properties:
    - it can go through local barriers,
    - it accelerates if the gradient does not change much,
    - it dampens oscillations in narrow valleys.

Dampening arises because of the accumulation of the gradients, which make them cancel each other.

---

class: middle

The hyper-parameter $\alpha$ controls how recent gradients affect the current update.
- Usually, $\alpha=0.9$, with $\alpha > \gamma$.
- If at each update we observed $g$, the step would (eventually) be
$$u = -\frac{\gamma}{1-\alpha} g.$$
- Therefore, for $\alpha=0.9$, it is like multiplying the maximum speed by $10$ relative to the current direction.

## AdaGrad

Per-parameter downscale by square-root of sum of squares of all its historical values.

$$\begin{aligned}
r\_t  &=  r\_{t-1} + g\_t \odot g\_t \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \frac{\gamma}{\delta + \sqrt{r\_t}} \odot g\_t.
\end{aligned}$$

- AdaGrad eliminates the need to manually tune the learning rate.
  Most implementation use $\gamma=0.01$ as default.
- It is good when the objective is convex.
- $r_t$ grows unboundedly during training, which may cause the step size to shrink and eventually become infinitesimally small.

???

Interpretation: 
- very steep, hence large gradients, the step size shrinks and eventually becomes infinitesimally small.
- very shallow, hence small gradients, the step size grows and eventually becomes very large.

Draw the two cases.

## RMSProp

Same as AdaGrad but accumulate an exponentially decaying average of the gradient.

$$\begin{aligned}
r\_t  &=  \rho r\_{t-1} + (1-\rho) g\_t \odot g\_t \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \frac{\gamma}{\delta + \sqrt{r\_t}} \odot g\_t.
\end{aligned}$$

- Perform better in non-convex settings.
- Does not grow unboundedly.

## Adam

Similar to RMSProp with momentum, but with bias correction terms for the first and second moments.

$$\begin{aligned}
s\_t  &=  \rho\_1 s\_{t-1} + (1-\rho\_1) g\_t \\\\
\hat{s}\_t &= \frac{s\_t}{1-\rho\_1^t} \\\\
r\_t  &=  \rho\_2 r\_{t-1} + (1-\rho\_2) g\_t \odot g\_t \\\\
\hat{r}\_t &= \frac{r\_t}{1-\rho\_2^t} \\\\
\theta\_{t+1} &= \theta\_t - \gamma \frac{\hat{s}\_t}{\delta+\sqrt{\hat{r}\_t}}
\end{aligned}$$

- Good defaults are $\rho\_1=0.9$ and $\rho\_2=0.999$.
- Adam is one of the **default optimizers** in deep learning, along with SGD with momentum.

## Weight decay

- Weight decay is a regularization technique that penalizes large weights.
- For vanilla SGD, it is equivalent to adding a penalty term to the loss function
$$\ell_\theta + \frac{\lambda}{2} ||\mathbf{\theta}||^2.$$
- For more complex optimizers, it is equivalent to adding a penalty term to the update rule
$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta\_t - \gamma \left(g_t + \lambda \theta \right).$$

  (e.g, by half every 10 epochs).
- Exponential decay: $\gamma\_t = \gamma\_0 \exp(-kt)$ where $\gamma\_0$ and $k$ are hyper-parameters.

In convex problems, provided a good learning rate $\gamma$, convergence is guaranteed regardless of the *initial parameter values*.

In the non-convex regime, initialization is **much more important**!

## Controlling for the variance in the forward pass

A first strategy is to initialize the network parameters such that activations preserve the **same variance across layers**.

Intuitively, this ensures that the information keeps flowing during the *forward pass*, without reducing or magnifying the magnitude of input signals exponentially.

---

class: middle

Let us assume that
- we are in a linear regime at initialization (e.g., the positive part of a ReLU or the middle of a sigmoid),
- weights $w\_{ij}^l$ are initialized i.i.d,
- biases $b\_l$ are initialized to be $0$,
- input features are i.i.d, with a variance denoted as $\mathbb{V}[x]$.

Then, the variance of the activation $h\_i^l$ of unit $i$ in layer $l$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{V}\left[h\_i^l\right] &= \mathbb{V}\left[ \sum\_{j=0}^{q\_{l-1}-1} w\_{ij}^l h\_j^{l-1} \right] \\\\
&= \sum\_{j=0}^{q\_{l-1}-1} \mathbb{V}\left[ w\_{ij}^l \right] \mathbb{V}\left[ h\_j^{l-1} \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
where $q\_l$ is the width of layer $l$ and $h^0_j = x_j$ for all $j=0,..., p-1$.

???

Do it on blackboard.

Use
- V(AB) = V(A)V(B)+V(A)E(B)+V(B)E(A)
- V(A+B) = V(A)+V(B)+Cov(A,B)

---

class: middle

Since the weights $w\_{ij}^l$ at layer $l$ share the same variance $\mathbb{V}\left[ w^l \right]$ and the variance of the activations in the previous layer are the same, we can drop the indices and write
$$\mathbb{V}\left[h^l\right] = q\_{l-1} \mathbb{V}\left[ w^l \right] \mathbb{V}\left[ h^{l-1} \right].$$

Therefore, the variance of the activations is preserved across layers when
$$\mathbb{V}\left[ w^l \right] = \frac{1}{q\_{l-1}} \quad \forall l.$$

This condition is enforced in **LeCun's uniform initialization**, which is defined as
$$w\_{ij}^l \sim \mathcal{U}\left[-\sqrt{\frac{3}{q\_{l-1}}}, \sqrt{\frac{3}{q\_{l-1}}}\right].$$

???

Var[ U(a,b) ] = 1/12 (b-a)^2

---

class: middle

## Controlling for the variance in the backward pass

A similar idea can be applied to ensure that the gradients flow in the *backward pass* (without vanishing nor exploding), by maintaining the variance of the gradient with respect to the activations fixed across layers.

Under the same assumptions as before,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{V}\left[ \frac{\text{d}\hat{y}}{\text{d} h\_i^l} \right] &= \mathbb{V}\left[ \sum\_{j=0}^{q\_{l+1}-1} \frac{\text{d} \hat{y}}{\text{d} h\_j^{l+1}} \frac{\partial h\_j^{l+1}}{\partial h\_i^l} \right] \\\\
&= \mathbb{V}\left[ \sum\_{j=0}^{q\_{l+1}-1} \frac{\text{d} \hat{y}}{\text{d} h\_j^{l+1}} w\_{j,i}^{l+1} \right] \\\\
&= \sum\_{j=0}^{q\_{l+1}-1} \mathbb{V}\left[\frac{\text{d} \hat{y}}{\text{d} h\_j^{l+1}}\right] \mathbb{V}\left[ w\_{ji}^{l+1} \right]
\end{aligned}$$

---

class: middle

If we further assume that
- the gradients of the activations at layer $l$ share the same variance
- the weights at layer $l+1$ share the same variance $\mathbb{V}\left[ w^{l+1} \right]$,

then we can drop the indices and write
$$
\mathbb{V}\left[ \frac{\text{d}\hat{y}}{\text{d} h^l} \right] = q\_{l+1} \mathbb{V}\left[ \frac{\text{d}\hat{y}}{\text{d} h^{l+1}} \right] \mathbb{V}\left[ w^{l+1} \right].
$$

Therefore, the variance of the gradients with respect to the activations is preserved across layers when
$$\mathbb{V}\left[ w^{l} \right] = \frac{1}{q\_{l}} \quad \forall l.$$

---

class: middle

## Xavier initialization

We have derived two different conditions on the variance of $w^l$,
- $\mathbb{V}\left[w^l\right] = \frac{1}{q\_{l-1}}$
- $\mathbb{V}\left[w^l\right] = \frac{1}{q\_{l}}$.

A compromise is the **Xavier initialization**, which initializes $w^l$ randomly from a distribution with variance
$$\mathbb{V}\left[w^l\right] = \frac{1}{\frac{q\_{l-1}+q\_l}{2}} = \frac{2}{q\_{l-1}+q\_l}.$$

For example, *normalized initialization* is defined as
$$w\_{ij}^l \sim \mathcal{U}\left[-\sqrt{\frac{6}{q\_{l-1}+q\_l}}, \sqrt{\frac{6}{q\_{l-1}+q\_l}}\right].$$

Previous weight initialization strategies rely on preserving the activation variance constant across layers, under the assumption that the input feature variances are the same.

\begin{aligned}
\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum\_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{d}} \mathbf{x} \quad\quad\quad \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum\_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{d}} (\mathbf{x} - \hat{\mu})^2.

Let us consider a minibatch of samples at training, for which $\mathbf{u}\_b \in \mathbb{R}^q$, $b=1, ..., B$, are intermediate values computed at some location in the computational graph.

In batch normalization following the node $\mathbf{u}$, the per-component mean and variance are first computed on the batch
$$
\hat{\mu}\_\text{batch} = \frac{1}{B} \sum\_{b=1}^B \mathbf{u}\_b \quad\quad\quad \hat{\sigma}^2\_\text{batch} = \frac{1}{B} \sum\_{b=1}^B (\mathbf{u}\_b - \hat{\mu}\_\text{batch})^2,
$$
from which the standardized $\mathbf{u}'\_b \in \mathbb{R}^q$ are computed such that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u}'\_b &= \gamma\odot (\mathbf{u}\_b - \hat{\mu}\_\text{batch}) \odot \frac{1}{\hat{\sigma}\_\text{batch} + \epsilon} + \beta
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\gamma, \beta \in \mathbb{R}^q$ are parameters to optimize.

During testing, the mean and variance computed on the entire training set and used to standardize the activations.
