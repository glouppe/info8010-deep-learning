Standard RNN-based sequence-to-sequence models compress an input sequence $\mathbf{x}\_{1:T}$ into a single thought vector $v$, and then produce an output sequence $\mathbf{y}\_{1:T'}$ from an autoregressive generative model
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{h}\_t &= \phi(\mathbf{x}\_t, \mathbf{h}\_{t-1})\\\\
v &= \mathbf{h}\_{T} \\\\
\mathbf{y}\_{i} &\sim p(\cdot | \mathbf{y}\_{1:i-1}, v).

This architecture assumes that the sole vector $v$ carries enough information to generate entire output sequences. This is often **challenging** for long sequences.

There are not direct "channels" to transport local information from the input sequence to the place where it is useful in the resulting sequence.

---

class: middle

Instead, attention mechanisms can transport information from parts of the input signal to parts of the output .bold[specified dynamically].

Under the assumption that each output token comes from one or a handful of input tokens, the decoder should attend to only those tokens that are relevant for producing the next output token.

Following Bahdanau et al. (2014), the encoder is specified as a bidirectional RNN that computes an annotation vector for each input token,
$$\mathbf{h}\_i = (\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_i, \overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_i)$$
for $i = 1, \ldots, T$, where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_i$ and $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_i$ respectively denote the forward and backward hidden recurrent states of the bidirectional RNN.

From this, they compute a new process $\mathbf{s}\_i$, $i=1, \ldots, T'$, which looks at weighted averages of the $\mathbf{h}\_j$ where the __weights are functions of the signal__.

Given $\mathbf{y}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{y}\_{i-1}$ and $\mathbf{s}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{s}\_{i-1}$, first compute an attention vector
$$\mathbf{\alpha}\_{i,j} = \text{softmax}\_j(a(\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}, \mathbf{h}\_j))$$
for $j=1, \ldots, T$, whered $a$ is an *attention scoring function*, here specified as a one hidden layer $\text{tanh}$ MLP.

Then, compute the context vector from the weighted $\mathbf{h}\_j$'s,
$$\mathbf{c}\_i = \sum\_{j=1}^T \alpha\_{i, j} \mathbf{h}\_j.$$

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

???

Note that the attention weights depend on the content, rather than on the position in sentence. This means they act as a form of *content-based* addressing.

---

class: middle

The model can now make the prediction $\mathbf{y}\_i$ as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}\_i &= f(\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}, y\_{i-1}, c\_i)  \\\\
\mathbf{y}\_i &\sim g(\mathbf{y}\_{i-1}, \mathbf{s}\_i, \mathbf{c}\_i),
\end{aligned}
$$
where $f$ is a GRU.

This is **context attention**, where $\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}$ modulates what to look in $\mathbf{h}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{h}\_{T}$ to compute $\mathbf{s}\_i$ and sample $\mathbf{y}\_i$.

# Attention layers

---

class: middle

The attention mechanisms can be defined generically as follows.

Given a context or query vector $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$, a key tensor $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$, and a value tensor $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v},$ an attention layer computes an output vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{v}$
with $$\mathbf{y} = \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_i(a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{K}\_i; \theta)) \mathbf{V}\_i,$$
where $a : \mathbb{R}^q \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a scalar attention scoring function.

---

class: middle

## Additive attention

When queries and keys are vectors of different lengths, we can use an additive attention as the scoring function.

Given $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$ and $\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$, the **additive attention** scoring function is
$$a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{w}_v^T \tanh(\mathbf{W}\_q^T \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{W}\_k^T \mathbf{k})$$
where $\mathbf{w}_v \in \mathbb{R}^h$, $\mathbf{W}_q \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times h}$ and $\mathbf{W}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times h}$ are learnable parameters.

---

class: middle

## Scaled dot-product attention

When queries and keys are vectors of the same length $d$, we can use a scaled dot-product attention as the scoring function.

Given $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, the **scaled dot-product attention** scoring function is
$$a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{k}) = \frac{\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{d}}.$$

---

class: middle

For $n$ queries $\mathbf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, keys $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ and values $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v}$, the **scaled dot-product attention** layer computes an output tensor 
$$\mathbf{Y} = \underbrace{\text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{QK}^T)}{\sqrt{d}}\right)}\_{\text{attention matrix}\, \mathbf{A}}\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times v}.$$

---

class: middle

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec8/dot-product.png)]

Recall that the dot product is simply a un-normalised cosine similarity, which tells us about the alignment of two vectors.

Therefore, the $\mathbf{QK}^T$ matrix is a **similarity matrix** between queries and keys.

class: middle

In the currently standard models for sequences, the queries, keys and values are linear functions of the inputs.

Given the learnable matrices $\mathbf{W}\_q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times x}$, $\mathbf{W}\_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times x'}$, and $\mathbf{W}\_v \in \mathbb{R}^{v \times x'}$, and two input sequences $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times x}$ and $\mathbf{X}' \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times x'}$, we have
$$\begin{aligned} 
\mathbf{Q} &= \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}\_q^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \\\\
\mathbf{K} &= \mathbf{X'} \mathbf{W}\_k^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d} \\\\
\mathbf{V} &= \mathbf{X'} \mathbf{W}\_v^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v}.
\end{aligned}$$

---

class: middle

## Self-attention

When the queries, keys and values are derived from the same inputs, the attention mechanism is called **self-attention**.

For the scaled dot-product attention, the self-attention layer is obtained when $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}'$.

Therefore, self-attention can be used as a regular feedforward-kind of layer, similarly to fully-connected or convolutional layers.

## A toy example

To illustrate the behavior of the attention mechanism, we consider a toy problem with 1D sequences composed of two triangular and two rectangular patterns. The target sequence averages the heights in each pair of shapes.

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec8/toy2.png)]

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

---

class: middle

The performance is expected to be poor given the inability of the self-attention layer to take into account absolute or relative positions. Indeed, self-attention is permutation-invariant:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y} &= \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_i\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}^T{\mathbf{K}^T\_{i}}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \mathbf{V}\_{i}\\\\
&= \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_{i}\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}^T{\mathbf{K}^T\_{\sigma(i)}}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \mathbf{V}\_{\sigma(i)}
\end{aligned}$$
for any permutation $\sigma$ of the key-value pairs.

---

class: middle

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec8/toy2-training.png)]

However, this problem can be fixed by providing positional encodings explicitly to the attention layer.

# Transformers

---

class: middle


Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed to go one step further: instead of using attention mechanisms as a supplement to standard convolutional and recurrent layers, they designed a model, the **transformer**, combining only attention layers.

The transformer was designed for a sequence-to-sequence translation task, but it is currently key to state-of-the-art approaches across NLP tasks.

## Scaled dot-product attention

The first building block of the transformer architecture is a scaled dot-production attention module
$$\text{attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d\_k}}\right) \mathbf{V}$$
where the $1/\sqrt{d\_k}$ scaling is used to keep the (softmax's) temperature constant across different choices of the query/key dimension $d\_k$.

## Encoder-decoder architecture

The transformer model is composed of:
- An encoder that combines $N=6$ modules, each composed of a multi-head attention sub-module, and a (per-component) one-hidden-layer MLP, with residual pass-through and layer normalization. All sub-modules and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension $d\_\text{model}=512$.
- A decoder that combines $N=6$ modules similar to the encoder, but using masked self-attention to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. In addition, the decoder inserts a third sub-module which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

]

???

---

class: middle

.center.width-90[![](figures/lec8/transformer-decoding-1.gif)]

The encoders start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ that will help the decoders focus on appropriate places in the input sequence.

---

class: middle

.center.width-90[![](figures/lec8/transformer-decoding-2.gif)]

Each step in the decoding phase produces an output token, until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output.

The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. 

.footnote[Credits: Jay Alammar, [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).]

---

class: middle

In the decoder:
- The first masked self-attention sub-module is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions.
- The second multi-head attention sub-module works just like multi-head self-attention, except it creates its query matrix from the layer below it, and takes the keys and values matrices from the output of the encoder stack.

class: middle

## Positional encoding

As each word in a sentence .italic[simultaneously] flows through the encoder/decoder stack, the model itself does not have any sense of position/order for each word.

Positional information is provided through an **additive** positional encoding of the same dimension $d\_\text{model}$ as the internal representation and is of the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PE}\_{t,2i} &= \sin\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d\_\text{model}}}}\right) \\\\
\text{PE}\_{t,2i+1} &= \cos\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d\_\text{model}}}}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

After adding the positional encoding, words will be closer to each other based on the similarity of their meaning and their relative position in the sentence, in the $d\_\text{model}$-dimensional space.

???

All words of input sequence are fed to the network with no special order or position; in contrast, in RNN architecture, 𝑛-th word is fed at step 𝑛, and in ConvNet, it is fed to specific input indices. Therefore, proposed model has no idea how the words are ordered.
