Given a set $\mathcal{X}$, if $S(\mathcal{X})$ denotes the set of sequences of elements from $\mathcal{X}$,
$$S(\mathcal{X}) = \cup\_{t=1}^\infty \mathcal{X}^t,$$

When the input is a sequence $\mathbf{x} \in S(\mathbb{R}^p)$ of variable length, the historical approach is to use a recurrent .bold[encoder-decoder] architecture that first compresses the input into a single vector $v$ and then uses it to generate the output sequence.

Recurrent encoder-decoder models compress an input sequence $\mathbf{x}\_{1:T}$ into a single thought vector $v$, and then produce an output sequence $\mathbf{y}\_{1:T'}$ from an autoregressive generative model
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{h}\_t &= \phi(\mathbf{x}\_t, \mathbf{h}\_{t-1})\\\\
v &= \mathbf{h}\_{T} \\\\
\mathbf{y}\_{i} &\sim p(\cdot | \mathbf{y}\_{1:i-1}, v).

This architecture assumes that the sole vector $v$ carries enough information to generate entire output sequences. This is often **challenging** for long sequences.

???

There are not direct "channels" to transport local information from the input sequence to the place where it is useful in the resulting sequence.

The problem is similar as last time with FCN without skip connections: the information is bottlenecked in the single vector $v$.

class: middle

Attention mechanisms can transport information from parts of the input signal to parts of the output .bold[specified dynamically].

Under the assumption that each output token comes from one or a handful of input tokens, the decoder should attend to only those tokens that are relevant for producing the next output token.

Same RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture, but with an attention mechanism in between.

---

class: middle

Following Bahdanau et al. (2014), the encoder is specified as a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) that computes an annotation vector for each input token,
$$\mathbf{h}\_j = (\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_j, \overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_j)$$
for $j = 1, \ldots, T$, where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_j$ and $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}\_j$ respectively denote the forward and backward hidden recurrent states of the bidirectional RNN.

From this, they compute a new process $\mathbf{s}\_i$, $i=1, \ldots, T'$, which looks at weighted averages of the $\mathbf{h}\_j$ where the .bold[weights are functions of the signal].

---

class: middle

Given $\mathbf{y}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{y}\_{i-1}$ and $\mathbf{s}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{s}\_{i-1}$, first compute an attention vector
$$\mathbf{\alpha}\_{i,j} = \text{softmax}\_j(a(\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}, \mathbf{h}\_j))$$
for $j=1, \ldots, T$, whered $a$ is an .bold[attention scoring function], here specified as a one hidden layer $\text{tanh}$ MLP.

Then, compute the context vector from the weighted $\mathbf{h}\_j$'s,
$$\mathbf{c}\_i = \sum\_{j=1}^T \alpha\_{i, j} \mathbf{h}\_j.$$

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

???

Note that the attention weights depend on the content, rather than on the position in sentence. This means they act as a form of *content-based* addressing.

---

class: middle

The model can now make the prediction $\mathbf{y}\_i$ as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}\_i &= f(\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}, y\_{i-1}, c\_i)  \\\\
\mathbf{y}\_i &\sim g(\mathbf{y}\_{i-1}, \mathbf{s}\_i, \mathbf{c}\_i),
\end{aligned}
$$
where $f$ is a GRU.

This is **context attention**, where $\mathbf{s}\_{i-1}$ modulates what to look in $\mathbf{h}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{h}\_{T}$ to compute $\mathbf{s}\_i$ and sample $\mathbf{y}\_i$.

# Attention layers

---

class: middle

The attention mechanisms can be defined generically as follows.

Given a context or query vector $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$, a key tensor $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$, and a value tensor $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v},$ an attention layer computes an output vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{v}$
with $$\mathbf{y} = \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_i(a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{K}\_i; \theta)) \mathbf{V}\_i,$$
where $a : \mathbb{R}^q \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a scalar attention scoring function.

---

.footnote[Credits: [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai), 2023.]

---

class: middle

## Additive attention

When queries and keys are vectors of different lengths, we can use an additive attention as the scoring function.

Given $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$ and $\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$, the **additive attention** scoring function is
$$a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{w}_v^T \tanh(\mathbf{W}\_q^T \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{W}\_k^T \mathbf{k})$$
where $\mathbf{w}_v \in \mathbb{R}^h$, $\mathbf{W}_q \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times h}$ and $\mathbf{W}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times h}$ are learnable parameters.

---

class: middle

## Scaled dot-product attention

When queries and keys are vectors of the same length $d$, we can use a scaled dot-product attention as the scoring function.

Given $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, the **scaled dot-product attention** scoring function is
$$a(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{k}) = \frac{\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{d}}.$$

---

class: middle

For $n$ queries $\mathbf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, keys $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ and values $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v}$, the **scaled dot-product attention** layer computes an output tensor 
$$\mathbf{Y} = \underbrace{\text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{QK}^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)}\_{\text{attention matrix}\, \mathbf{A}}\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times v}.$$

---

class: middle

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec7/dot-product.png)]

Recall that the dot product is simply a un-normalised cosine similarity, which tells us about the alignment of two vectors.

Therefore, the $\mathbf{QK}^T$ matrix is a **similarity matrix** between queries and keys.

---

class: middle

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec7/qkv-maps.png)]

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

---

class: middle

In the currently standard models for sequences, the queries, keys and values are linear functions of the inputs.

Given the learnable matrices $\mathbf{W}\_q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times x}$, $\mathbf{W}\_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times x'}$, and $\mathbf{W}\_v \in \mathbb{R}^{v \times x'}$, and two input sequences $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times x}$ and $\mathbf{X}' \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times x'}$, we have
$$\begin{aligned} 
\mathbf{Q} &= \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}\_q^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \\\\
\mathbf{K} &= \mathbf{X'} \mathbf{W}\_k^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d} \\\\
\mathbf{V} &= \mathbf{X'} \mathbf{W}\_v^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times v}.
\end{aligned}$$

---

class: middle

## Self-attention

When the queries, keys and values are derived from the same inputs, the attention mechanism is called **self-attention**.

For the scaled dot-product attention, the self-attention layer is obtained when $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}'$.

Therefore, self-attention can be used as a regular feedforward-kind of layer, similarly to fully-connected or convolutional layers.

Compare visually on the blackboard and show the similarities and differences.

CNNs:
- Strengths: Parallel processing, efficient for shorter sequences
- Limitations: Limited context window defined by kernel size
- Key point: O(log_k(n)) path length (with pooling) means information flows through fewer transformations than RNNs

RNNs:
- Strengths: Natural handling of sequential data, memory-efficient
- Limitations: Sequential processing creates bottlenecks
- Key point: O(n) path length means information decay over long sequences

Self-Attention:
- Strengths: Direct connectivity between any positions, O(1) path length
- Limitations: O(n²) complexity becomes prohibitive for very long sequences
- Key point: This quadratic complexity is the price we pay for the rich representational power

---

class: middle

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec7/complexity.png)]

where $n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the embedding dimension, and $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions.

???

As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence
length n$$ is smaller than the representation dimensionality $d$, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. 

A single convolutional layer with kernel width $k < n$ does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of $O(n/k)$ convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or $O(logk(n))$ in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of $k$.

## A toy example

To illustrate the behavior of the attention mechanism, we consider a toy problem with 1d sequences composed of two triangular and two rectangular patterns. The target sequence averages the heights in each pair of shapes.

We can modify the toy problem to consider targets where the pairs to average are the two right and leftmost shapes.

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec7/toy2.png)]

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

---

class: middle

The performance is expected to be poor given the inability of the self-attention layer to take into account absolute or relative positions. Indeed, self-attention is permutation-invariant:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y} &= \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_i\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}^T{\mathbf{K}^T\_{i}}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \mathbf{V}\_{i}\\\\
&= \sum\_{i=1}^m \text{softmax}\_{i}\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}^T{\mathbf{K}^T\_{\sigma(i)}}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \mathbf{V}\_{\sigma(i)}
\end{aligned}$$
for any permutation $\sigma$ of the key-value pairs.

(It is also permutation-equivariant with permutation $\sigma$ of the queries.)

---

class: middle

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec7/toy2-training.png)]

However, this problem can be fixed by providing positional encodings explicitly to the attention layer.

# Transformers

---

class: middle

Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed to go one step further: instead of using attention mechanisms as a supplement to standard convolutional and recurrent layers, they designed a model, the .bold[transformer], combining only attention layers.

The transformer was designed for a sequence-to-sequence translation task, but it is currently key to state-of-the-art approaches across NLP tasks.

.footnote[Credits: Francois Fleuret, [Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/dlc/), UNIGE/EPFL.]

---

class: middle

## Scaled dot-product attention

The first building block of the transformer architecture is a scaled dot-production attention module
$$\text{attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d\_k}}\right) \mathbf{V}$$
where the $1/\sqrt{d\_k}$ scaling is used to keep the (softmax's) temperature constant across different choices of the query/key dimension $d\_k$.

---

class: middle

.center.width-55[![](figures/lec7/multi-head-attention.svg)]

## Multi-head attention

The transformer projects the queries, keys and values $h=8$ times with distinct linear projections to $d\_k=64$, $d\_k=64$ and $d\_v=64$ dimensions respectively.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{multihead}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) &= \text{concat}\left(\mathbf{H}\_1, \ldots, \mathbf{H}\_h\right) \mathbf{W}^O\\\\
\mathbf{H}\_i &= \text{attention}(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{W}\_i^Q, \mathbf{K}\mathbf{W}\_i^K, \mathbf{V}\mathbf{W}\_i^V)
\end{aligned}
$$
with
$$\mathbf{W}\_i^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_\text{model} \times d\_k}, \mathbf{W}\_i^K \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_\text{model} \times d\_k}, \mathbf{W}\_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_\text{model} \times d\_v}, \mathbf{W}\_i^O \in \mathbb{R}^{hd\_v \times d\_\text{model}}$$

## Encoder-decoder architecture

The transformer model is composed of:
- An encoder that combines $N=6$ modules, each composed of a multi-head attention sub-module, and a (per-component) one-hidden-layer MLP, with residual pass-through and layer normalization. All sub-modules and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension $d\_\text{model}=512$.
- A decoder that combines $N=6$ modules similar to the encoder, but using masked self-attention to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. In addition, the decoder inserts a third sub-module which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

---

class: middle

.center.width-90[![](figures/lec7/transformer-decoding-1.gif)]

The encoders start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ passed to the decoders.

.footnote[Credits: Jay Alammar, [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).]

---

class: middle

.center.width-90[![](figures/lec7/transformer-decoding-2.gif)]

Each step in the decoding phase produces an output token, until a special symbol is reached indicating the completion of the transformer decoder's output.

The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. 

.footnote[Credits: Jay Alammar, [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).]

---

class: middle

In the decoder:
- The first masked self-attention sub-module is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions.
- The second multi-head attention sub-module works just like multi-head self-attention, except it creates its query matrix from the layer below it, and takes the keys and values matrices from the output of the encoder stack.

.footnote[Credits: Jay Alammar, [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).]

class: middle

## Positional encoding

Positional information is provided through an **additive** positional encoding of the same dimension $d\_\text{model}$ as the internal representation and is of the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PE}\_{t,2i} &= \sin\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d\_\text{model}}}}\right) \\\\
\text{PE}\_{t,2i+1} &= \cos\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d\_\text{model}}}}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

After adding the positional encoding, words will be closer to each other based on the similarity of their meaning and their relative position in the sentence, in the $d\_\text{model}$-dimensional space.

Alternatively, the model can also learn the positional encoding.

???

All words of input sequence are fed to the network with no special order or position; in contrast, in an RNN, the 𝑛-th word is fed at step 𝑛, and in a CNN, it is fed to specific input indices.

## Scaling laws

Transformer language model performance improves smoothly as we increase the model size, the dataset size, and amount of compute used for training. 

For optimal performance, all three factors must be scaled up in tandem. Empirical performance has a power-law relationship with each individual factor when not bottlenecked by the other two.
