R: reading assingment:http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/project-proposal-instructions.pdf
R: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/courses/csc2541/index.html projects


R: add overview maps for each lecture, as in INFO8002
R: lec10 on RL -> restructure partly as a lecture on World Models -> nice comprehensive pedagogical example (combine mdn, rnn, vae, rl) into a big network
R: lec - theory of DL -> universal approx theorem, double descent


R: projects -> use github classroom https://classroom.github.com/

## Textbook

None!

But we would recommend "Dive into Deep Learning" ([d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/)) for a comprehensive and practical introduction to the field.

# Philosophy

## Thorough and detailed
- Understand the foundations and the landscape of deep learning.
- Be able to write from scratch, debug and run (some) deep learning algorithms.

## State-of-the-art
- Introduction to materials new from research ($\leq$ 5 years old).
- Understand some of the open questions and challenges in the field.

## Practical
- Fun and challenging course project.
